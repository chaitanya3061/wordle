Wordle is a word guessing game. Each day you have to guess a new word. You have 6 attempts and each attempt you make reveals some information.

1)You have to guess the Word in six step or less and the word should be of five lettered.
2)Every word you enter must be in the word list. There are more than 5000 words in my word.js file and it generates random word for every game and that is exported to my main file.
3)A correct letter turns green.
4)A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow.
5)An incorrect letter remains same color.
6)Letters can be used more than once.
